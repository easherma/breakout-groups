  Howdy Chi Hacksters! This project has been automatically marked as 'stale' because we have not seen

  Hey hey Chi Hacksters. In order to keep our lists of active projects tidy, we've closed this one becuase 
  it seems ya'll have moved on to something else. 
  
  If this is not the case, our apologies! Simply re-open the issue and you'll be back in business!
